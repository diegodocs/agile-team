# Principles

As a team member, I want to follow our principles:

1. Everything is code and must be versioned
1. No sensitive data in code repositories
1. Standardize programming languages and developer experience (apps, infra, sec, qa and etc)
1. Extensible Architecture
    - start from what is necessary but keep it extensible
    - reusable components with single responsibility
    - observability (logging/metrics)
    - testability
    - promote artifacts instead of promote code (immutability)
    - cost/budget track and visibility (FinOps)
1. PR and pipelines for code quality/sec validation (gates)
1. Automate everything that can be automated
