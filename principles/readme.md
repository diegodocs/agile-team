# Principles

As a team member, I want to follow our principles:

1. Everyone is part of Continuous Learning Journey
1. Everything is code and must be versioned
1. No sensitive data in code repositories
1. Standardize developer experience (DevEx) for all teams(apps, infra, sec, qa and etc)
1. Extensible Architecture
    - prioritized by Business Value-Based Impact
    - start from what is necessary but keep it extensible
    - reusable components with single responsibility
    - observability (logging/metrics)
    - testability
    - promote artifacts instead of promote code (immutability)
    - cost/budget track and visibility (FinOps)
1. PR and pipelines for code quality/sec validation (gates)
1. Automate everything that can be automated
