# Requirements

## What

Software requirements are the conditions or capabilities that a software system must have to meet the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders. There are different types of software requirements, depending on the level of detail, the perspective, and the purpose of the specification. Some of the common types are:

- **Functional requirements**: These describe what the software system should do, in terms of the functions, features, behaviors, and operations that it provides to the users. Functional requirements are usually expressed in natural language, structured language, or formal language, and they can be verified by testing or inspection.
- **Non-functional requirements**: These specify how well the software system should perform, in terms of the quality attributes, constraints, and standards that it must satisfy or adhere to. Non-functional requirements are often related to the systemâ€™s performance, security, usability, reliability, maintainability, portability, scalability, and so on. They can be measured by metrics, benchmarks, or audits.
