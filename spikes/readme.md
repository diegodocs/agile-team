# Spikes and Evaluation

## What ?

A spike in software development refers to a method used to explore potential solutions, reduce uncertainty, and address technical risks.

### How It Works

- A spike involves creating the simplest possible program or prototype to investigate a particular issue.
It is used to determine how much effort will be required to solve or work around a software problem.
- Spikes can be technical (evaluating new technologyâ€™s impact) or functional (assessing interaction with a new feature).
- Familiarizing the team with new hardware or software.
